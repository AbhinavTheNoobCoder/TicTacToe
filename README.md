# TicTacToe
Play TicTacToe against a computer which makes random moves or against a friend.
All you have to do is give inputs as instructed by the code.
When asked to enter a coordinate, please look at the board to understand which square refers to which coordinate.
Do not expect much from the computer opponent since it ONLY makes RANDOM moves and doesn't think strategically.
